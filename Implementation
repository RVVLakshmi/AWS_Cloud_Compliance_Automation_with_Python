Step 1: Set Up AWS Environment and Python Development

Create an AWS Account: If you don't have one, sign up for an AWS account and set up your environment.

Install Python: Ensure Python is installed on your local machine and set up your Python development environment.

Step 2: Create AWS IAM Roles and Policies

IAM Roles: Create IAM roles for your Lambda functions, granting them the necessary permissions to interact with AWS resources.

IAM Policies: Define IAM policies for your roles, specifying what actions are allowed on which resources.

Step 3: Develop Python Lambda Functions

Python Code: Write Python scripts for your Lambda functions. These scripts should include logic for compliance checks and actions, such as converting EBS volumes from GP2 to GP3.

AWS SDK: Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to interact with AWS services within your Lambda functions.

Step 4: Create CloudWatch Event Rules

CloudWatch Events: Set up CloudWatch Event Rules to trigger your Lambda functions in response to specific AWS events, like EBS volume creation.
Step 5: Test Your Automation

Local Testing: Test your Python Lambda functions locally to ensure they perform the desired actions when triggered.

Deploy to AWS: Deploy your Lambda functions to AWS, and configure the event rules to trigger them based on the defined events.

Step 6: Real-time Monitoring with CloudWatch

CloudWatch Metrics: Use CloudWatch to monitor the performance and health of your AWS resources in real-time.

Alerts: Configure CloudWatch alarms to send alerts when certain thresholds are breached.

Step 7: Documentation and README

Create README: Write a comprehensive README.md file for your project, including instructions on how to set up, configure, and use the automation.
Step 8: Version Control and Collaboration

Git Repository: Set up a Git repository on GitHub to manage your project's version control.

Collaboration: Invite team members to collaborate on the project through GitHub, and use Git branches for collaborative development.

Step 9: Continuous Improvement

Iterate and Enhance: Continuously improve your project by adding new compliance checks, refining automation, and optimizing resource usage.

Documentation: Update your documentation to reflect any changes or enhancements to the project.

Step 10: Deployment and Scaling

Deploy to Production: Once thoroughly tested, deploy your project in the production AWS environment.

Scaling: Consider strategies for scaling your automation to handle a larger number of resources and events efficiently.
